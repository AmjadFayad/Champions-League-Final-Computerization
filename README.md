# Champions-League-Final-Computerization
The organizers of the football Champions League want to computerize the information of the final match including the squad of the two teams and the score sheet. For reasons of simplicity, we assume that the number of the players on the field (lineup) of a team is 4 (instead of 11). Each team has also a set of players on the bench (substitutes) for eventual substitutions during the match.
